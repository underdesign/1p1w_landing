<h5>Under Design's Web Design Special</h5>
<h1>1 Page in 1 Week for $1,000</h1>
<h3>We'll give you a one-page custom website that drives your business into the next century in one week! (Just like this!)</h3>
<p>Maybe you already have a site, but it's not making you money, or it's unchanged after years of ignorance.  I don't want to sell with a negative lead, but intregue customers with simplicity, attention and customization as selling points.</p>

		<h2>The Benefits of our Wisdom / Product</h2>

<p>We'll try and keep the terminology siple and to-the point.  No technical terms or acronyms to look up.  Stright facts to a fellow business operator.</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="four columns">
			<h5>Static Pages</h5>
			<p>Your site will act like a self-sufficient island in the middle of an ocean, they need not rely on any language or operating system to keep running.  It can be moved, backed up, and duplicated easily.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="four columns">
			<h5>Small &amp; Fast</h5>
			<p>We use tricks learned from decades of website development to deliver your message with as little overhead as possible. It'll load quickly and reliably on the slowest of networks. Images will be highly optimized for size and use.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="four columns">
			<h5>Mobile-Ready</h5>
			<p>Your site will look similar on all sorts of sizes of screens, so no one is forced to squint to read all about you. Your audience will increase as new devices come to market.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
	
<p>These are touted as benefits, or offer a more slick looking package, but at a cost of slower load times, more overhead, useless code libraries, and more.</p>

	<div class="row">	
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>No Useless Animation</h5>
			<p>Animation without intent is distraction.  Flying boxes and shifting icons only distract readers from the copy that will sell them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>No Bloat</h5>
			<p>Checked and Verified HTML, then it's optimized & streamlined for the host. Support graphics are condensed into sprites for quicker load and less web requests. No single-use scenario code left embedded. No jQuery, which we find to be bloated Javascript library for lazy programmers </p>
		</div>
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>Copy &gt; Pictures</h5>
			<p>You know that Google doesn't direct traffic to your site due to pictures you use or colors you choose.  Often, using copyrighted images will get a cease-and-decist order, or a demand for copyright payments.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>No Menus</h5>
			<p>Why sub-divide your limited copy and benefits across multiple pages, just to increase clicks, or simply frustrate your users who don't know where you put that bit of information?  Do your visitor the favor by answering the obvious above the fold, but keeping all your info in one place.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>No Search</h5>
			<p>Limited content and page scope means it won't get lost in the millions of other sites out there.  A well-tuned static site only grows in search reputation the longer it stays around.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two columns">
			<h5>No Closed Source</h5>
			<p>Each job is a public (but copyrighted) repository on GitHub, to allow simple backup and changes. We write standards compliant HTML5, check it thoroughly, and use open-source code as available.</p>
